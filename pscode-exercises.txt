// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

 Start
 Read the first number (num1)
 Read the second number (num2)
 Set the variable sum = num1 + num2
 Display the sum
 End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

 Start
 Read the number (num)
 If num modulo 2 is equal to 0, then
 Display "The number is even"
 Else
 Display "The number is odd"
 End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

 Start
 Initialize the variable sum to 0
 Initialize the variable minimum to infinity
 Initialize the variable maximum to negative infinity
 Set count = 0
 Repeat the following steps 5 times:
 Read the number (num)
 Add num to sum
 If num is less than minimum, then
 Set minimum = num
 If num is greater than maximum, then
 Set maximum = num
 Increment count by 1
 Set average = sum / 5
 Display "The average is: " concatenated with average
 Display "The minimum is: " concatenated with minimum
 Display "The maximum is: " concatenated with maximum
 End
